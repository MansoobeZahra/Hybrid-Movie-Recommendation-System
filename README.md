#  Hybrid Movie Recommendation System

A powerful hybrid movie recommendation engine combining **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** techniques using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Surprise** libraries.

---

##  Project Overview

This system intelligently recommends movies to users by blending two core methods:

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests movies similar to ones a user has liked, based on genres, tags, and descriptions.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Predicts user preferences based on the ratings of other similar users.

Together, this hybrid approach improves recommendation accuracy by leveraging both item features and user behavior.

##  Features

- 🔍 Recommends movies based on movie metadata (genres, overview, tags, keywords)
- 👥 Predicts ratings using user-user and item-item similarities
- 🧠 Combines **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** for content-based filtering
- 📊 Uses **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** from `surprise` for collaborative filtering
- 💡 Hybrid logic that blends both approaches for better personalization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn** (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)
- **Surprise** (SVD algorithm)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and visualization

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔹 Content-Based Filtering

- Uses movie metadata (genres, tags, plot) to create a TF-IDF matrix
- Calculates **cosine similarity** between movie vectors
- Recommends movies similar to the ones rated highly by the user

### 🔹 Collaborative Filtering

- Uses historical user ratings from the MovieLens dataset
- Trains a matrix factorization model using **SVD**
- Predicts unseen ratings based on similar users and items

### 🔹 Hybrid Logic

For a given movie and user:

1. Compute similar movies using content-based filtering  
2. Use collaborative filtering to estimate user ratings for those similar movies  
3. Recommend the top **N** movies with highest predicted ratings
